# Weather-Lamp
IoT device - Lamp displaying info and changing apperance depending on the weather. I made this during our exam in Embedded Systems. We were limited to use a kit of components. If there had been no limitations to the project I would have used LED's for better spreading of the light.

The lamp is connected Sol.no's weather API and changes its color depending on the temperature. There are also LED's indicating how strong the wind is and how much rainfall it is.

To get a more lamp feeling over the project I 3D modelled and printed a case with a screen.

## Images of the project - See the "bilder" folder for more pictures/videos!
